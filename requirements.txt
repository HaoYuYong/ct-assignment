# Project Dependencies for Cryptographic Hash Functions
#
# This file specifies the exact Python packages required to run the SHA-256 implementations.
# 
# Why this file is needed:
# - Ensures consistent environment across different machines
# - Allows automatic installation of required dependencies
# - Provides version control for numerical computations
# - Essential for reproducible research and assessment grading
#
# numpy>=1.21.0: Required for 32-bit integer operations and precise mathematical calculations
# in SHA-256 algorithm implementations across all assessment problems.
